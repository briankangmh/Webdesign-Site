        <h2>Beethoven's 26th Sonata: A Story of Separation and Reunion</h2>
        <p id="introp1">Instead of a self portrait that showcases myself, I wanted to make one that reflects my inner mental life, and there's no better way to express that than an exploration of some music by Beethoven, my favorite composer. Classical music is more than just "nice melodies" as we tend to think of music; it's an actual story with characters and scenes full of tension, buildup, and release, like an exciting movie. This interactive storyboard takes you through short clips from a Beethoven Sonata, giving you an shortened experience of the entire story, the way a movie trailer might with a movie.</p>
        <p id="introp2">Beethoven's 26th Sonata is called "Das Lebewohl" in German, which roughly means a heartfelt goodbye. It's a story of being sorrowfully separated from a dear friend or loved one, and eventually reuniting. I imagine this story through an episode in the life of a young girl, where she must be separated from her boyfriend due to external circumstances. Each panel describes what the musical "scene" might look like as an actual movie scene.</p>

        <h2>Movement 1 — The Parting</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="para paralight">
        <p data-file="1.m4a" id="num1">The couple sits near one another at home, and the boy has his bags packed and is about to leave. As the first three chords play, the girl breaths in feebly and slowly, then lets out a deep sigh as the last of three chords release her breath. Slow, sombre tones fill the air as the couple feel each other slipping away, not wanting to separate. (Beethoven explicitly wrote that the first three chords represent the syllables in the word "Lebewohl"—"farewell" in German.)</p>

        <p data-file="2.m4a" id="num2">The boy slowly pulls the door to a close, but suddenly the girl grabs him by the hand and yanks him in again. "You can stay for just 5 more minutes!". She runs around setting his bags down again, and scrambles desperately to set up their favorite snack on the table, as if nothing is changing at all. She lunges down with him on the couch and smiles like a crazy person.</p>

      <div class="para paralight">
        <p data-file="3.m4a" id="num3">The boy tells her insistantly but gently that he needs to leave now, but she keeps pulling him back ever so feebly, unwilling to let him go. They banter back and forth. We hear a dialogue between two voices in the music softly arguing over confused chords, one pulling away each time while the other pulls it back. Suddenly, she yells, "Stay here!", completely determined. He smothers her with a hug. "Ok, I'm not going anywhere", he responds sadly.</p>

        <p data-file="4.m4a" id="num4">"Goodbye! I love you! I'll miss you!", the girl frantically shouts everything she can think of at once, and then suddenly... the boy steps out and the door closes as the music suddenly calms down again. A soft medley of gentle, bittersweet tones fills the air as the girl finds herself standing alone in silence. The sound of her boyfriend trotting  down the stairs outside rings as a gently "bouncing" figure plays in the music, and the girl dares to peek outside the window one last time. She catches a final, precious glimpse of him fading further away into the distance as the music "twinkles" into the higher register and gently fades out.</p>

        <p data-file="5.m4a" id="num5">It is the next morning, and the girl finds herself alone in the house. It feels unreal to have woken up all by herself, and eerie, melancholy tones gently pulsate as she weakly walks around, experiencing the eerie silence of loneliness.</p>

She walks briskly, determined to remain happy in her boyfriend's absence. She walks through a beautiful park, taking in the fresh air and snow.</p>

She starts panting desperately and collapses onto a nearby bench for support as crushing, suffocating chords boom. She finds that carrying on alone is not so easy. She runs out of breath and turns her head up, light headed and dizzy.</p>

        <p data-file="8.m4a" id="num8">"I can't do this", she thinks. She sits alone on the grass, defeated. She allows herself to do something she promised not to do: fantasize about seeing him again. She stares dumbly into the distance, daydreaming about what it would be like to see him agian, and dreamy, feeble tones play. Out of the blue, a familiar hand gently grasps her shoulder from behind. Can it be...?</p>
