        <h2>Web 2.0/Web Sqaured Readings</h2>
        <button id="surprise">~Click for a surprise~</button>
        <p>My initial reaction from the readings is to feel pretty creeped out. In the Web Squared reading the author said “objects in the real world have ‘information shadows’ in the cyber world”, meaning that in some way or another everything can be traced via data—including people. In the same way enough data allows software on the net to become aware of places on the map, products on the market, songs and artists, etc., people leave their own digital shadows which can be used to trace them. This is really scary to think about when you realize it means mega companies that control data, (especially one that rhymes with Boogle) have immense power and influence over society today. At lease in the US we have a government that can somewhat pin down the data beasts, however incompetently, but what about governments like China that don’t even hide the fact that they directly use the power of data to keep their citizens in line? Scary stuff.
        </p>
        <p>The web 2.0 reading also made me realize that the winners of the modern web are those that are willing to spam their influence everywhere and win by pure numbers, like how Google adsense completely dominated DoubleClick by opening their ad services for sites to use liberally in dirty, spammy looking boxes and crappy interfaces, rather than DoubleClick’s tailored service and displaying ads in neat boxes in clean interfaces. Sad to think that the product that wins out in the end is not the one that tries to deliver the highest quality experience, but the one that’s willing to do the dirty of gaining power in numbers by welcoming every scrap of data from every corner it can find. Another example of this is that google orders its search engine content by looking at the raw number of links to a page, thereby showing you results that are most popular, not necessariy with the highest quality content. Although this works out for the better in most situations, it also means clickbait, manipulation, and downright misinformation can rise to the top as long as it can game the algorithm.</p>
