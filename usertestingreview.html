        <h2>User Testing Review</h2>
        <p>My website was really a hot mess before anyone gave me pointers. I really had no idea how to structure my site on either the macro or micro level. My site is pretty structurally complex too because I need to have a mosaic grid of images (all different sizes) that is responsive and adjusts appropriately to the window size, and I need to have a clickable profile picture in the corner, which needs to be appropriately sized too and align with the sidebar and header appropriately. Everything was an absolute mess: the pictures were wierdly sized, the header and sidebar were getting squished or growing way too big, the grid was spilling off the page, etc. I got a few tips from user tests but am still pretty lost. Ashia gave me some grid sizing tips like giving it a percentage width so it doesn’t spill over past the window but I still need to figure out how to do that without making the image proportions wierd and distorted. Lily helped me size the profile picture in the corner so it wasn’t just a tiny thumbnail, but I still need to adjust its position and such. George listened to my struggles and gave me sympathy. Alex, an absolute wizard, introduced me to the viewport meta tag in the head, and helped me get one photo to fit in the entire space of a div.
